• Selecting and engineering features.
• Selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation.
• The main challenges of Machine Learning, in particular underfitting and overfitting
(the bias/variance tradeoff).
• Reducing the dimensionality of the training data to fight the curse of dimensionality.
• The most common learning algorithms: Linear and Polynomial Regression,
Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Decision
Trees, Random Forests, and Ensemble methods.

## Part II, Neural Networks and Deep Learning, covers the following topics:
• What are neural nets? What are they good for?
• Building and training neural nets using TensorFlow.
• The most important neural net architectures: feedforward neural nets, convolutional
nets, recurrent nets, long short-term memory (LSTM) nets, and autoencoders.
• Techniques for training deep neural nets.
• Scaling neural networks for huge datasets.
• Reinforcement learning.
The first part is based mostly on Scikit-Learn while the second part uses TensorFlow.

## Week 29 – [PART I - The Fundamentals of Machine Learning]

Based on the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow*, answers these questions:

**What is Machine Learning?**
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every task, a machine learning system improves its performance as it is exposed to more data.

**What problems does it try to solve?**
Machine Learning is used to solve problems where traditional programming is impractical or impossible, such as:
- Recognizing objects in images or speech in audio
- Predicting outcomes (e.g., credit approval, disease diagnosis)
- Detecting anomalies or fraud
- Recommending products or content
- Automating tasks that require adaptation to new data

**What are the main categories and fundamental concepts of Machine Learning systems?**
- **Supervised Learning:** The system learns from labeled data (input-output pairs), e.g., classification and regression tasks.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** The system finds patterns or structures in unlabeled data, e.g., clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Semi-supervised Learning:** Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** The system learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

**Fundamental Concepts:**
- **Model:** A mathematical representation of a real-world process.
- **Training:** The process of fitting a model to data.
- **Features:** The input variables used to make predictions.
- **Labels:** The target values (in supervised learning).
- **Overfitting/Underfitting:** When a model learns too much noise or too little from the data.
- **Generalization:** The model’s ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Criteria to measure model performance (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).
